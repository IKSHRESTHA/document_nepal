# The Actuary’s New Challenge: Navigating Post-Protest Risks in Nepal’s Insurance Landscape

## 1. Introduction — A Wake-Up Call for Risk Models

In early September 2025, Nepal experienced the deadliest unrest in decades. A youth-led "Gen Z" uprising, triggered by a government ban on dozens of social media platforms, rapidly escalated into violent protests across Kathmandu and other cities. The unrest led to widespread arson and attacks on public and private properties, forced political resignations, and significant economic disruption. Reported human casualties numbered dozens killed and thousands injured.

For Nepal’s insurance industry, these events highlight a critical lesson: large economic losses from civil commotion can exist even when insured claims are relatively modest. Actuaries must therefore broaden their risk frameworks beyond historical claims data and adopt forward-looking scenarios that account for protection gaps and systemic accumulation.

## 2. What Happened — Corruption, Nepotism, and Digital Mobilization

The immediate trigger — a social media ban — ignited long-standing grievances about corruption, nepotism, joblessness, and inequality. A tech-savvy, networked generation organized rapidly using online platforms (including large Discord communities), enabling swift mobilization, virtual decision-making, and coordinated action. Over 48 hours the protests intensified: security forces used crowd-control weapons, protesters set fires, and iconic government buildings and politically connected private properties were damaged.

Key takeaway for risk modelers: these events are driven by a combination of a catalyst (policy action) and a backlog of social discontent. Models should therefore capture both trigger and latent-sentiment dynamics.

## 3. Financial vs Insured Losses — A Tale of Two Scales

The unrest caused extensive economic damage, but insured losses were a small fraction of the total. Key figures:

- Preliminary national economic loss estimates reached approximately NPR 3 trillion (near half of Nepal's annual GDP). The unrest targeted iconic government buildings such as Singha Durbar (the prime minister's office complex), the Parliament and the Supreme Court, led to the destruction of police stations and other public infrastructure, and also damaged private properties tied to political parties and leaders' residences.
- Insured claims reported to date totaled around NPR 22.25 billion (2,478 claims), concentrated in the Kathmandu (Bagmati) region. Several factors help explain why this insured figure is small relative to the national economic loss: government-owned assets (including many of the high-profile targets) were largely uninsured, so damage to public buildings generated few or no claims; the protests were geographically decentralised rather than strictly concentrated in one insured-rich district, while insurance penetration is highest in urban centres—meaning many damaged assets outside cities were uninsured; and the primary targets included government offices and politically linked properties, many of which lack comprehensive commercial insurance, limiting the number of claimants.
- The industry shock was concentrated among a few large insurers and lines: property and motor claims dominated, and major insurers reported multi-billion exposures. Two structural features influenced the claims mix. First, third-party motor insurance is compulsory in Nepal, and vehicle policies commonly include SRCC cover or extensions, which helps explain the high volume of motor claims. Second, commercial properties financed through bank loans often carry mandatory insurance covenants (banks require property cover as a loan condition), which increases claims from corporate and financed assets relative to uninsured private holdings. Together, these regulatory and contractual requirements shape which losses reach insurers and which remain uninsured.

Context: Nepal’s total non-life premiums are small (roughly NPR 45 billion), and total market premiums (life + non-life) are in the NPR 140–150 billion range. Thus, insured losses from a single SRCC event can represent a large fraction of annual premium income and strain capital adequacy.

Immediate effects and near-term risks for insurers and policyholders

The unrest generates a cluster of immediate and short-term consequences that go beyond headline claim totals. Below we expand each channel of impact, how it operates, and what insurers should consider doing now.

1) Direct cash outflows, liquidity pressure and reinsurance effects
- What happens: Insurers must pay valid claims quickly, often before reinsurance recoveries arrive. The ~NPR 20.7 billion shown above is a near-term cash demand; once loss settlement and adjustment costs are included, near-term cash outflows will be higher.
- Why it matters: Small markets with concentrated claims face acute liquidity stress — large payments can absorb a sizeable share of annual premiums and available liquid assets.
- Immediate insurer actions: Prioritise cash-flow modelling, contact reinsurers early to confirm coverage and recovery timelines, and prepare contingent liquidity plans (credit lines, repo of short-term assets, regulatory notifications).

2) Operational disruption and emergency response costs
- What happens: Branch damage, staff displacement, and IT or communications disruptions raise operational costs. Insurers may need to set up temporary claims centres, provide emergency advances to policyholders, and reallocate staff to triage and field work.
- Why it matters: These costs are direct P&L line items and can be persistent if facilities remain unusable.
- Immediate insurer actions: Activate business continuity plans, prioritise critical branches and systems for repair, document emergency expenses for potential regulatory or governmental support, and centralise claims intake to manage fraud risk.

3) Security spillovers and secondary-crime waves
- What happens: The unrest can produce secondary criminal activity — looting, burglaries, and organized-theft — especially where law-and-order is temporarily weakened (e.g., breaches of detention or missing police arms). Such crime waves typically lag the unrest and can produce a second pulse of property claims.
- Why it matters: A second wave of claims increases frequency and may hit lines (home, SME, commercial property) with lower underwriting margins.
- Immediate insurer actions: Monitor crime-data feeds and police reports, issue targeted guidance to policyholders on loss mitigation (secure premises, increase surveillance), prepare specialized fraud/investigation teams, and re-evaluate short-term underwriting restrictions for vulnerable areas.

4) Claims-handling cost inflation and anti-fraud workload
- What happens: Chaotic event environments increase the administrative burden per claim (verification, salvage, forensic inspections). Fraud attempts tend to rise after large, concentrated events.
- Why it matters: Even if average claim sizes are steady, higher per-claim processing costs reduce underwriting profitability and slow settlement timelines.
- Immediate insurer actions: Triage claims by size and vulnerability, increase investigator capacity (internal or outsourced), standardise rapid documentation packs for claimants to speed validations, and use digital intake channels to reduce operational overhead.

5) Business interruption (BI) and contingent losses
- What happens: Many insured businesses suffer lost revenue while operations are suspended. Even assets that survive physically can generate substantial BI claims if supply chains or customer access is disrupted.
- Why it matters: BI claims can be larger and have longer tails than physical damage claims, and many BI exposures are underinsured or poorly understood.
- Immediate insurer actions: Prioritise early settlement conversations for smaller BI claims to support recovery, document interruption periods carefully, and engage with larger corporate clients to understand outage duration and downstream impacts.


6) Longer-tail effects and reserve management
- What happens: Delays in reporting, legal actions, and emergent contingent liabilities (e.g., third-party liability, reputational suits) lengthen the claims tail and create IBNR uncertainty.
- Why it matters: Under-reserving risks solvency; over-reserving can unnecessarily choke growth and competitiveness.
- Immediate insurer actions: Run multiple IBNR scenarios (best/central/worst), document assumptions, and consider catastrophe margins or a strategic capital buffer until reporting stabilises.



Taken together, these channels show why a single SRCC event can produce sustained financial and operational strain in a small market like Nepal. The near-term priority is robust cash and reserve management, followed by targeted operational and anti-fraud capacity to limit secondary losses and preserve insurer solvency and market confidence.

## 4. The Actuarial Dilemma — Pricing the Uninsured Risk
Relying solely on historic claims to quantify SRCC (strikes, riots and civil commotion) exposure is demonstrably insufficient in small, low-penetration markets like Nepal. The 2025 unrest exposes three critical actuarial problems: incomplete exposure visibility (many economic losses are uninsured), conversion risk (the next event could hit more heavily insured portfolios), and structural correlation (SRCC events are systemic rather than idiosyncratic). The net effect is deeper tails, higher accumulation risk and greater model uncertainty than most standard pricing and reserving frameworks assume.

Below we translate these observations into concrete modeling, reserving and capital implications and then provide a short, practical checklist for actuarial teams.

Modeling and data implications

- Exposure mapping and accumulation modeling

- Scenario-based stress testing (AAL/PML framing): 

- Correlation, contagion and non-linear aggregation: 


Reserving, IBNR and tail risk

- IBNR and reporting lags

- Case reserve adequacy and large-loss reviews:

- Risk margins and catastrophe loadings


Capital and solvency implications

- Reinsurance and retention strategy
- Liquidity planning vs capital adequacy

- Concentration risk metrics



Closing note: The actuarial response must be pragmatic — model uncertainty is large, but so is the potential impact. By combining higher-quality exposure data, scenario-driven AAL/PML analysis, and robust reserve/capital playbooks, actuaries can translate the messy reality of SRCC into actionable management information and credible reinsurance negotiations.
